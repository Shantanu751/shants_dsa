I tried to make a online shopping model.
A similar service is provided by flipkart, ebay and many other companies.
Each buyer and seller has a username and pass.
Admin overlooks everything like sellers, buyers and all other offers.
Seller can offer products for a price.
Seller can also manage price and available quantity of products he offers.
Buyer can search for a product.
He could search in different categories and brands and apply coupons.
View and cancel previous transactions.
Money transactions and networking was ignored.
